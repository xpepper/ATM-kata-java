# TODO list
* [F] withdrawal bundles of only 5â‚¬ notes 
  - withdrawal should raise an exception when cannot be performed
  - a `Bundle` object should be created instead of a poor hashmap? (and it should have a `value` method too?)
* [F] withdrawal bundles of other denominations too (10, 20, 50)
* [F] it should be disallowed to load negative quantities of banknotes
* [!] `Denomination` is a simple `enum`... is it enough?
* [R] tests should be refactored to iterate over all the available `Denomination`s?

## doubts

* [?] why starting from the `billsFor`? What's the strategy here? Maybe to "learn" about the problem domain?
