# TODO list

* [!] `Denomination` is a simple `enum`... is it enough?
* [!] smell: the denomination value (e.g. FIVE_EURO has a value of 5) is still not relevant in the system
* [R] tests should be refactored to iterate over all the available `Denomination`s?
* [?] why starting from the `billsFor`? What's the strategy here? Maybe to "learn" about the problem domain?
